# Godot Engine Task

We all love to play games, right? What if we get a taste of game development now? Let's dive deeper into that!

With the template we have provided for you, give movements to a character in a 2D game in Godot Engine. This engine uses GDScript as its language which is very similar to Python.

This template already lets you move the characters and make them jump. But now try doing these:

- You have to put coins in the game for the player to collect. Every time the player collects a coin, the score should increase. You can also add audio when the character collects a coin and animate the movement of the sprite. All the necessary resources are given in the repo.

- Show game over screen when the score reaches 20.

- *(Bonus)* Find out what Tile Maps are in Godot and then create your own level of the game.

# Given Template

<div align="center">
  <img src="/task-12/GFX/details/game-dev (DEBUG) 2022-08-20 09-30-44_Trim.gif" width="400" height="250"/>
</div>

The template we have provided is a scene with basic character controls. Note that there is no animation given to the character while moving. You can see how the template looks in the above *.gif* file.

# Your Task

<div align="center">
  <img src="/task-12/GFX/details/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" width="550" height="315"/>
</div>

As you can see in the above GIF, your task is as follows:
- As there is no animation when the player moves in the given template, animate the player's movement using the given resources.
- Make the player collect coins and also add a sound effect when it's collected. (Note: It is optional to show the number of coins collected.)
- To make a very simple level using the given resources on your own.
